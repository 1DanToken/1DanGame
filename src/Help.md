### Game Purpose

The purpose of the **1Dan Nightmares Game** is to:
- have **FUN** with your **1Dan Nightmares** collectibles
- earn **1Dan** tokens
- investigate AI capabilities creating non-trivial code logic

**1Dan** tokens can be won every day based on the value of your collectibles in the game.
The value of your collectibles in the game determines also your level. 
The level decides how many collectibles you are allowed to have in the game.

AI is used to develop the game and manage as many aspects of it as possible.
The game project is therefore an AI experiment, even if it remains a relatively simplistic nightmare for now.
This approach aligns with the strategy of using AI to create the nightmare images in the collection.
Hopefully, the game's features and complexity will evolve alongside advances in AI capabilities.

#### -- Entering the Game

You can log in with:
* **Cloud Wallet**
* **Anchor Wallet**

The first time you log in, you can select your alias in the game.
For now, you can use just one WAX network address per alias.

The wallet is used to sign a transfer of a tiny amount of 0.00000001 WAX.
This transfer is used to verify the user address on the WAX blockchain.

Some notes about **Cloud Wallet**
* Do not hide the WAX address in the wallet UI. It's needed when the login action is done.
* For some reason the wallet window might close before the verification transaction is performed. Just try again. Or use the **Anchor Wallet** that does not have this problem.

#### -- Collectibles

You can add collectibles to the game.
You can remove collectibles from the game.

Only collectibles from the **1Dan Nightmares** collection (WAX name: ainightmares), that you own, can be used.

The collectibles used in the game might already be staked elsewhere on the WAX network. 
Also it's OK to stake collectibles that you have in the game.

A collectible\'s **TEMPLATE_ID** (without the 'hash' character) is used to find it on the WAX blockchain. 
You can see this ID in the collectible's metadata on **Uncut.Network** and **AtomicHub**.

#### -- Levels

You start at Level 0. You will be at this level when your in-game collectibles have a total WAX value between 0 and 99.
Level 1 requires collectibles with a total WAX value between 100 and 199. 
Level 2 requires collectibles with a total WAX value between 200 and 299, and so on. 
There is no level limit.

A collectible's WAX value is the WAX price that you paid to buy the collectible.
A collectible bought with ArtX is always valued at 0.1 WAX.
If a collectible is sold (after being added to the game) it's price will be set to 0 in the game. 
You can remove it then from the game and free a slot for another collectible.

At each level:
- 0, 1, 2: up to 20 collectibles are possible
- 3: up to 30 collectibles are possible
- 4: up to 40 collectibles are possible
- and so on...

You can go up in levels as you add collectibles and their total value increases.
However, you can also go down in levels when you remove or sell collectibles.

In other words, adding more valuable collectibles enables you to progress in levels.
The level determines how many collectibles you can add to the game.

#### -- Earning **1Dan** Tokens

You will earn **1Dan** tokens every day based on the total value of your collectibles in the game.

Earning formula: (Collectibles WAX Value / 100) **1Dan** tokens per day

Example:
- On a specific day: Level 2, collectibles with a WAX value of 250: 2.5 **1Dan** tokens earned that day.

It will be possible to exchange **1Dan** tokens for **1Dan Nightmares** collectibles. 
Currently, the exchange mechanism has not been decided yet.

For now, **1Dan** is just a token within this game. 
In the future, it is possible to introduce the token on the WAX blockchain. 
When that happens, your **1Dan** game holdings can be exchanged for the WAX blockchain **1Dan** token.

### Game Roadmap
